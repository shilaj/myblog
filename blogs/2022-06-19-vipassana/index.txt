2:T5c1,
At the Vipassana center we are taught to observe our sensations (itching, tickling, prickling, tingling or anything you feel). Observing these sensations mean, be it a pleasant sensation or an unpleasant sensation, we are asked to work our way out to remain equanimous. If we try not to differentiate sensations then we may find ourselves unmoved by any kind of suffering or elation in our everyday life. Because the entry point for any good or bad feeling is through five sense organs (eye, ear, tongue, nose and skin) and the thought process. If we learn somehow to operate these six senses on our own volition, then that's what it is meant to going to the root. The most wonderful part is, you would know you've come down to the roots of your sensations. Sitting down observing yourself when you go on understanding the technique, the sensations that felt irritating once is treated on par with the most wondrous sensation. Case in point, being almost idle while medidating had created stress on my knees, and I believed in the technique when this pain got dissolved, just like bursting of water bubble. Now, if anything comes up and I get a feeling of agitation or something, I try to observe my sensations first. I try to remain calm and try to understand inspite of reacting to it. So, Vipassana has changed the way I used to see. It has taken me from gloom to the way of light, confinement to the way of liberation and it feels like I am understanding myself more. 5:["slug","2022-06-19-vipassana","d"]
