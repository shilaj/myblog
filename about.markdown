Hi! Welcome to my website. I hope you'd enjoy seeing whatever I am upto these days. If I have to give a little background on me, I am a "[Researcher](http://ninelab.creatorlink.net/index#MEMBERS/)" trying to get into the ins and outs (pun intended) of the Fluid Dynamics with the help of Neural Networks. <br><br>
Also, I love to combine words in such a way that they sound poetic sometimes. If you are willing to waste your time then please feel free to dwell around.
