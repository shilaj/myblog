Hey there! it's nice to see you here. Currently, I have been dedicating my time in understanding the fluid behaviour and intricacies of Neural Networks. My goal for a few years now is to hybridize both of the fields and see if I can merely support the research community in the field. For now, lets contemplate this couplet by **Lewis F. Richardson**:  <br><br>
***Big whirls*** have ***little whirls*** <br>
which feed on their velocity, <br>
And ***little whirls*** have ***lesser whirls*** <br>
And so on to viscosity. <br><br>
Ever and anon, I find myself trying to create a piece of poetry or similar. Well, I can also play some chords in the guitar, and even sing a song or two. Please, look around. If anything interests you, fuel me up with comments or feel free to hit any of the buttons below ðŸ‘‡
