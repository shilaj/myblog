Hey there! it's nice to see you here. Currently, I have been dedicating my time in understanding the fluid behaviour and intricacies of Neural Networks. My goal for a few years now is to hybridize both of the fields and see if I can merely support the research community in the field.  <br><br>
Ever and anon, I find myself trying to create a piece of poetry or similar. Well, I can play some chords in the guitar and even sing a song or two.  On a final note, if you have heart for literature, I have left mine open [here](./literature/index.html).
