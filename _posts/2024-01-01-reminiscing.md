Oh! I don't see hands on hands these days,<br>
devotion seems like a bloody maze,<br>
I gaze upon the sky and chase the stars,<br>
to reflect back to my old school days.<br>

Nothing pestering the mind, only thoughts of play,<br>
in her gentle touch my heart would sway,<br>
her eyes would caress my inner soul,<br>
such was the love we used to enjoy. <br>

But today, when I peek out of my windows hole,<br>
I hear the echoes of Burglar's toll, <br>
danger! danger! is what it says, <br>
oh! this gen is trapped in a holy maze <br>
oh! this gen is trapped in a holy maze. <br>
