I build computational tools that merge **machine learning** with high-fidelity **computational fluid dynamics** to advance nuclear safety and reactor design. My work explores surrogate modeling for turbulence, differentiable solvers, and autonomous validation pipelines.

Current focus areas include:

- Physics-informed neural operators for multiphase flows.
- Real-time uncertainty quantification for sensor fusion.
- Human-in-the-loop visualization for explainable CFD.

Outside the lab, I mentor students, co-organize the _AI for Nuclear_ seminar series, and contribute to open-source tooling for scientific reproducibility.
