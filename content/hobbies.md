The lab slows down after midnight. That's when I shift into **playful prototyping**—building quick sensors, sketching haiku, or improvising with visualization palettes for the next day's plots.

Highlights from the poems and projects notebook now live here as a rotating gallery. Everything is markdown-driven so I can swap entries in seconds.
